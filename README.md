# DataLit-Crime-Project
 This is our project submission for the "Data Literacy" course by Prof. Dr. Philipp Hennig.

# Topic: Analyzing the "Polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik" (PKS)
The PKS refers to crime statistics released by the Bundeskriminalamt (German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation). 
Within the scope of this project, we conduct an exploratory data analysis on various tables found in the PKS, focusing either on spatial or temporal data.

# Overview
- spatial_exploration.ipynb and temporal_exploration.ipynb contain our analysis and related plots
- Datasets contais all used data sorted by years
- scr contains necessary files to import and process the data
- doc contains our report and used plots

# Installation manual
Installation via ``pip`` is recommended. If prompted, we can also provide a conda environment which wasn't as reliable as a pip-based environment in our tests.

## Virual Environment
### Windows
Create a virtual environment by running in your repository:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:
```
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

You can then install the required packages with:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Unix and MacOS
Create a virtual environment by running:
```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
You can then install the required packages with:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
